I'm excited to apply my 1.5+ years of Node.js expertise to build scalable 
backend systems at AppifyDevs. Having optimized RESTful APIs and 
MongoDB databases in production environments, I'm particularly drawn to 
your focus on architectural patterns like CQRS - which aligns perfectly 
with my interest in clean, maintainable systems. The opportunity to 
mentor junior developers while working with technologies like NestJS and 
WebSockets would allow me to contribute my experience in real-time 
systems and third-party integrations. I'm especially impressed by 
AppifyDevs' commitment to cutting-edge solutions and would love to help 
drive key database architecture decisions.
